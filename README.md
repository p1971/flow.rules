## Why use a rules engine ?

### Benefits

Using a rules engine allows the centralization of the logic within an application. This is easier to maintain, easier to test and can simplify process flow.

A simple analogy of this would be validation rules for a user input form.

A bad process, from the user perspective, would be to validate one rule at a time; the user enters some data, submits and is presented with an error. The user corrects re-submits and sees another error, corrects and re-submits and so on. A better approach is to validate the whole form in one go showing the user all the current errors on the form, allowing them to correct and re-submit in one go.

For general business processes the principle is the same; gather all the required data, submit it to the rules engine and check the response. If the response is valid, continue processing, else terminate the process.

This works very well when paired with a [workflow engine](https://github.com/p1971/flow.engine).

Lets consider a traditional process flow.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B([Is valid]);
    B-->C;
    B--Not valid-->Exit;
    C-->D([Is within limits]);
    D-->E
    D--Not valid-->Exit;
    
```

And now with a rules engine.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
   A([Check rules])-->B;
   A--Not valid-->C([Exit])
   B-->D;
   D-->E;    
```

### Downsides

There are some downsides to this approach.

Some rules engines use a DSL (domain specific language) which would require developers to switch away from a language they are familiar with to one they may not know and is perhaps harder to debug.

In order or present a rich domain model to the rules engine, the process flow may require expensive service calls to provide all the data that the engine needs. This might be short circuited in a more traditional approach, skipping un-necessary api calls for example. This can be alleviated however by splitting the rules policies / process flow into a pre and post-process steps for example.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A([Execute pre-validation policy])-->B([Failed]);
    A--Success-->C;   
    C--Get additional data-->D;
    D([Execute post-validation policy])--Success-->E;
    D-->B;

```

## Getting started

### FlowRules concepts

A policy is a collection of rules.

| Name           | Description                                 | Example             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Id             | A unique identifier for the policy.         | P0001               |
| Name           | A human readable name for the policy.       | BasicDecisionPolicy |
| Description    | A description for the policy.               | Basic checks.       |
| Rules          | The list of rules belonging to the policy.  |                     |

A rule is an assertion which must be true to pass.

| Name           | Description                                                   | Example     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Id             | A unique identifier for the rule.                             | R0001       |
| Name           | A human readable name for the rule.                           | ValidateAge |
| Description    | A description for the rule.                                   | Checks the applicants age.            |
| FailureMessage | A function that returns a failure message, if the rule fails. The request data is passed to the function. | ```(r) => $"{r.Name} is too young."```             |
| Source         | The actual rule code to execute, the request data and a cancellation token are passed.                              | ```(r, c) => r.Age > 21```            |

### A simple dto to apply rules against

```csharp
public record MortgageApplication(int ApplicantAge, string MortgageType, int LoanAmount);
```

### The rules policy

```csharp
public class PolicyBuilder 
{
    public Policy<MortgageApplication> GetPolicy()
    {
     Rule<MortgageApplication> validMortgageTypeRule = new(
        "MA001",
        "KnownMortgageType",
        "Checks the mortgage type",
        (r) => $"The {nameof(r.MortgageType)} [{r.MortgageType}] is not known.",
        (request, token) =>
        {
            switch(request.MortgageType)
            {
                case "FTB":
                    return Task.FromResult(true);
                default: 
                    return Task.FromResult(false);
            }
        });

    Rule<MortgageApplication> ageLimitRule = new(
        "MA002",
        "MinAgeCheck",
        "Minimum age of the applicant",
        (r) => $"The {nameof(r.ApplicantAge)} [{r.ApplicantAge}] is too young.",
        (request, token) =>
        {
            int minAgeForMortgage = 21;
            return Task.FromResult(request.ApplicantAge >= minAgeForMortgage);
        });

    Policy<MortgageApplication> policy = new(
        "P001",
        "LoanPolicy",
        new List<Rule<MortgageApplication>>
        {
            validMortgageTypeRule,
            ageLimitRule,        
        });
       return policy;
    }
}
```

### Registering the services and executing a request

```csharp
ServiceCollection serviceCollection = new();

serviceCollection.AddFlowRules<MortgageApplication>(() => policy);

ServiceProvider serviceProvider = serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();

IPolicyManager<MortgageApplication> policyManager = serviceProvider.GetService<IPolicyManager<MortgageApplication>>();

MortgageApplication testMortgage = new(21, "FTB", 200_000);

CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource = new();
CancellationToken cancellationToken = cancellationTokenSource.Token;

PolicyExecutionResult results = await policyManager.Execute(Guid.NewGuid(), testMortgage, cancellationToken);
```

### Logging results

Results are logged via the `IPolicyResultsRepository<in T>` implementation. The default implementation just logs to `ILogger<T>`.

The interface is fairly simple:

```csharp
Task PersistResults(T request, PolicyExecutionResult policyExecutionResult);
```

Where `PolicyExecutionResult` contains the policy and individual rule results.

`FlowRules.Extensions.SqlServer` contains an implementation that writes the results to SQL Server.

The [SqlServerPolicyResultsRepository.sql](https://github.com/p1971/flow.rules/blob/develop/src/FlowRules.Extensions.SqlServer/SQL/SqlServerPolicyResultsRepository.sql) can be used to create the database / schema required.

In order to use the SQL Server implementation, it can be registered when registering the FlowRules.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFlowRules<MortgageApplication>(PolicySetup.GetPolicy, (c) =>
{
    c.ResultsRepository = typeof(SqlServerPolicyResultsRepository<MortgageApplication>);
});

```

Custom implementations can be registered similarly.

### Monitoring performance

Counters are provided for the execution time of the policy and invidual rules.

For example:

```bash
dotnet counters monitor --name FlowRules.Samples.WebApi --counters FlowRules
```

example response:

```bash
[FlowRules]
    P001 (ms)                                          100
    P001:MA001 (ms)                                     20
    P001:MA002 (ms)                                     30
    P001:MA003 (ms)                                     40
    P001:MA004 (ms)                                     50
```
